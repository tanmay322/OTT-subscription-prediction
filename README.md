# OTT-subscription-prediction
This project aim to visualize data of Movies currently streaming on OTT streaming services. 

I used a Kaggle dataset named "MoviesOnStreamingPlatforms_updated.csv" for analysis. 
This dataset contains about 16700 movies that are streamed on 4 different streaming websites namely: 
  HULU, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney
  
I focus on provide a visual analysis for any individual to easily decide which streaming device would provide maximum streaming content.
